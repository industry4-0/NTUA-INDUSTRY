# Automatic visual defect detection in industrial products using deep learning methods
This repository contains our team's (*NTUA-INDUSTRY*) project for the competition *Industry 4.0* hosted by **crowdpolicy**

## 🏭 Project Description

 * Quantity and quality automation in *manufacturing* is a demand not a privilege. In this direction, our team proposed a system to resolve the *material quality control* problem. Human Inspection is an error prone \& time consuming process and results in false positives
  * Parts corectly detected as faulty provoke loss in upstream labor, consumables as well as revenue
  * Parts wrongly detected as faulty provoke a market reaction and eventually a unrepairable damage to company's reputation 

* In that direction every automation system that can early detect false positives without human intervation, while being cost-effective for the customer, is preffered.
